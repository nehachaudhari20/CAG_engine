# CAG Engine

CAG Engine is a DAG-based execution runtime for agent systems.

It provides:
- Explicit control-flow graphs
- Deterministic execution
- Stateful transitions
- Full traceability

This repository focuses on **execution control**, not prompting or generation.

LLMs are optional tools, not decision-makers.
